========

Demonstrates one of the index problems described in Titan [issue 788](https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan/issues/788).

Reproduced in JanusGraph [issue 410](https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/issues/410).

The problem is the number of commits, not the re-loading of edges. Please check out the unit test in `src/test/java`.
